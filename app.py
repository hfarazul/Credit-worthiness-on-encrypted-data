            It is a complex process that involves several entities: the applicant, the bank, the
            credit bureau, and the credit scoring agency. When you apply for a credit card, you
            provide personal and financial information to the bank. This might include your income,
            employment status, and existing debts. The bank uses this information to assess your
            creditworthiness. To do this, they often turn to credit bureaus and credit scoring
            agencies.
            - Credit bureaus collect and maintain data on consumers' credit and payment
            histories. This data includes your past and current debts, payment history, and the
            length of your credit history.
            - Credit scoring agencies use algorithms to analyze
            the data from credit bureaus and generate a credit score. This score is a numerical
            representation of your creditworthiness.
            - The bank uses your credit score, along with
            the information you provided, to make a decision on your credit card application. A
            higher credit score generally increases your chances of being approved and may result
            in better terms (like a lower interest rate).

            the greater the risk of a data breach. This can lead to identity theft and financial
            fraud. There's also the issue of data accuracy. Mistakes in credit reports can lead to

            Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is seen as an ideal solution for enhancing privacy
            and accuracy in credit scoring processes involving multiple parties like applicants,
            banks, credit bureaus, and credit scoring agencies. It allows data to be encrypted and
            processed without ever needing to decrypt it. This means that sensitive data can be
            shared and analyzed without exposing the actual information to any of the parties or
            the server processing it. In the context of credit scoring, this would enable a more
            thorough and accurate assessment of a person's creditworthiness. Data from various
            sources can be combined and analyzed to make a more informed decision, yet each party's
            data remains confidential. As a result, the risk of data leaks or breaches is
            significantly minimized, addressing major privacy concerns.

            To summarize, FHE provides a means to make more accurate credit eligibility decisions
            while maintaining strict data privacy, offering a sophisticated solution to the delicate
            balance between data utility and confidentiality.
